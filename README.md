Privacy Policy

In this privacy policy, we describe what kind of data we may collect of you in connection with your use of our games, applications, websites and related services and how we may use such data. Below we call these collectively “Services”. By using our Services, you agree to the processing of your data in accordance with this privacy policy.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time by posting a new version online so please review it frequently. Your continued use of our Services after the posting of a new version is deemed as your acceptance of the modified terms.

What Data We Collect and Why?

We may collect personal data that identifies you if you submit it to us (for example if send us an email query regarding our services). We may use this data to provide Services to you, improve our Services and contact you. We don’t collect personal data providing our game services. We do not collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such data, then please contact us so we can remove such data.

Analytics Data

We use analytical services and other tools (such as Google Analytics) on areas of our Services which enable us to collect your IP address, other identifiers, usage data relating to our Services, as well as device information. Based on this data we may create statistics to provide better services to our customers and to further develop our Services. This data is not personalised and only accessible in an aggregated form. We treat this information as non-personal data.

You can disable Google Analytics with this tool: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout

Ad Serving Through Third Parties

Our Services use built-in advertising run by third-party advertising networks to enhance the in-game experience. Such advertisements allow us to offer you our Services for free.

Advertisers use IDFA (device identifier for advertisers). This identifier can be matched to you, and is used for marketing. It is shared with third parties who may use it for personalized marketing. Allowing third parties to advertise in our games allows us to offer our Services to you for free.

Advertising networks handle your IDFA in accordance with their respective privacy policies, which you can consult on their website. A list of the advertising networks we typically work with is below. From time to time we may change the advertising networks we work with without updating our Privacy Policy.

We are using the following tools to serve advertisements in our services. The use of data of these advertising services is described in their linked privacy policies.

Admob (Google): https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/
Unity Ads: https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy
AppLovin: https://www.applovin.com/privacy/
When you view an advert in our apps, the advertising network receives and processes your unique Identification for Advertising (IDFA). Advertising networks use this to send you advertising. You can reset and/or disable your IDFA at any time by following these instructions:

Resetting Your IDFA

Resetting your IDFA erases all data previously associated with it, meaning you will no longer receive personalised ads.

On Android:
Open Google Settings
Go to ‘Ads’
Tap on ‘Reset Advertising ID’
Confirm the reset
You can also choose not to receive personalized advertising by opting-out of interest-based ads. Just toggle off the ‘Opt-out of interest-based ads’ option.

On iOS:
Open Settings
Go to ‘Privacy’
Tap on ‘Advertising’
Choose ‘Reset Advertising Identifier’
You may also see our own advertisements in other services. If you click such advertisements and install our game, we may share a device identifier with the advertiser to verify installs, because the ad-networks need to be accredited for facilitating the install.

Cookies and Other Identifiers.

We and our partners may use cookies and other identifiers (such as clear gifs or pixel tags). With cookies and other identifiers, we and our partners can provide a better user experience. You may delete the cookies from your device after using our Services. If you disable cookies on your browser, some parts of our Services may not function properly.

Data Security and Data Sharing

We take responsibility to safeguard your data. All of your data is protected in accordance with generally accepted industry standards. We may use partners and contractors to process data for us in accordance with this privacy policy.

We do not share your personal data to third parties without your consent unless we are compelled to do so by law or when we face exceptional situations, such as detection or prevention of misuse or criminal activities.

We may publish aggregated or de-personalised data based on our users’ information (such as statistics) provided that such information does not identify you.

We may process your data outside the country where you live in (for example if you are an EU citizen, outside the EU or the European Economic Area). This can happen, for instance, if the service provider of our analytical services is located outside your country. In such cases, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data is processed lawfully and in accordance with this privacy policy.

External Links

Our Services may contain links to external sites. Such as Facebook links, YouTube links and link content from external third party sources. Please note that the use of such third party sites or content is subject to the privacy policies and usage terms of the third party in question instead of our own terms and we do not have control or assume any liability over such content.
